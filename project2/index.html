		<!-- About Me -->
		<h3>Let's Talk!</h3>
		<p>I am 20 years old and live in the north suburbs of Chicago. I drive to school Monday through Thursday and listen to music to dull my anger for the traffic. I got my first computer at the age of seven and have since been learning about computers. I play video games (PS4 > Xbox One) like Rainbow Six Siege, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Rocket League. I'm more of a competitive player than casual. I have about six years of graphic design experience with Photoshop and Illustrator. I do graphic design as a hobby and sometimes make money on the side from it. Teaching myself video editing as well using After Effects and Premiere Pro. I've been doing web development for a number of years now and currently manage a volleyball club website.</p>
